# SmellyN3rd's Auto Ricing Utility

## What is SARU?

SARU is a simple script that automatically installs all needed programs and copies my configs to make a complete working archlinux system

## Installation

Note that this script is meant to be run on archlinux, so if you're on a diffrent distro this project is not for you

`curl -sL miloszkusz.pl/SARU.sh | sh`
