# SmellyN3rd's Auto Ricing Utility

## What is SARU?

SARU is a simple script that automatically installs all needed programs and copies my config to make a complete working archlinux system

## Installation

Note that this script is meant to be run on archlinux, so if you're on a diffrent distro this project is not for you

`curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmellyN3rd/SARU/main/SARU.sh && sh SARU.sh`

## Configuration files

All configuration is stored in my [dotiles](https://github.com/SmellyN3rd/dotfiles) repository
